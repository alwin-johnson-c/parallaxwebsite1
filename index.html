        <h2>findings</h2>
        <P>In a country like India, we have close to 80% literacy, but when it comes to 
            financial literacy, we are not that lucky. In 2019, National Centre for Financial 
            Education did a survey which says that only 27% of Indians are financial 
            literate. So, we have a long distance to travel and put a lot of responsibility on 
            spreading the message of financial literacy across the country. 
            Indian population is estimated at 138 Cr people in 2020 according to UN 
            data. Indian population is equivalent to 17.7% of the total world population 
            over 76% of Indian adults lacks basic financial literacy and they don’t 
            understand the most basic and key financial literacy and they don’t 
            understand the most basic and key financial concepts. The survey report says 
            that financial literacy in India has been significantly poor to the rest of the 
            world. 
            In case of stock market, A majority of Indians avoid investing their money in 
            stock market. In fact, out of a population of 1.3 Billion, there are only 18 
            million (2% of population) invest in equity market. It is similar story for the 
            mutual fund market in India, only 2 cores investors less than 1.5% of 
            population. 
            Comparatively, equities account for just 12.9% of investments in India 
            compared to 26.1% in the rest of the world. </P>
